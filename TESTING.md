# Testing the hana-client cookbook

To test your changes, you need access to an SAP client `.sar` as well as the
`sapcar` to extract it.

You can update the kitchen file with the details of your file, and run some
docker tests.  Alternately, you may also use the test suites in other clouds
 and environments for added platform coverage.
